<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> Aerial Survey Processing App</h4>
<p>This app aids the user in processing aerial survey data and generating a report pdf that is then emailed to stakeholders. Any right whale sightings are then intergrated into the <a href="https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/psb/surveys/MapperiframeWithText.html">Right Whale Sightings Advisory System</a> and the “Trigger Analysis” app (below) is used to evaluate for potential dynamic protection zones.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.2</span> Trigger Analysis</h4>
<p>This app is used to evaluate if visual sightings or acoustic detections trigger dynamic management areas (aka right whale SLOW zones), and then it calculates the boundaries. A report and letter are generated here that detail the area where vessels should reduce their speeds, and these products are then emailed to GARFO to initiate the request. A kml is also generated which is used to display the zone on the <a href="https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/psb/surveys/MapperiframeWithText.html">Right Whale Sightings Advisory System</a> interactive map.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> How often is it used?</h3>
<p>The Aerial Survey Processing App is used after every right whale aerial survey – for example, in 2019, NEFSC surveyed for right whales on 92 different days, so this is a frequently used tool.</p>
<p>The Trigger Analysis App is used each time a right whale sighting is reported to the Right Whale Sighting Advisory System to evaluate for a dynamic protection zone. In 2019, Dynamic Management Areas were initiated or extended 29 times, but the app was used more than this to evaluate sightings that also did not trigger these zones.</p>
<p>The Photo Position Finder App is generally used 2–3 times a year when we organize our photo data for submission.</p>

<div id="application-purpose-2" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Application Purpose</h3>
<p>The Biological Sample Monitoring Database System (BSMDBS) was developed for the Northeast Fisheries Regional Office and the Northeast Fisheries Science Center to record and monitor biological samples of commercially important marine species in the Northwest Atlantic collected by Port Agents. Samples include the collection of animal lengths and age structures (otoliths, scales, spines, etc.) which are strategically requested to attain a representative spatial and temporal sample of the associated stocks. All sampling is performed after the vessel lands their catch. With the implementation of electronically collected data, a modern version of the dataset (BSM) was created as an extension of the sampling effort.
Sampling data are most commonly used to inform the stock assessment process, develop length/age models, and to characterize commercial fisheries. This app allows the user to query all existing commercial fisheries biological sampling data, provides summaries of the sampling efforts in interactive figures and tables, and provides a sample size comparison for optimizing sampling efforts and determining future sampling requests.</p>
<div id="user-specifications" class="section level4" number="2.3.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.1</span> User Specifications</h4>
<p>The user populates the widgets in the interface on the left side of the page (species, range of fiscal years, and stat areas) and then clicks the <strong>RUN</strong> button to begin the query. A status bar showing progress then appears in the bottom right corner of the page until the process is complete and the app then changes from the <strong>Read Me</strong> tab to the <strong>Collected Samples</strong> tab where results are shown.</p>
<p><img src="images/BioSamplingLand.png" /><!-- --></p>
</div>
<div id="app-results" class="section level4" number="2.3.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.2</span> App Results</h4>
<p>Once the query has finished executing, the results are divided into tabs across the top.
The <strong>Collected Samples</strong> tab shows a table of sample collection results that can be sorted, searched, and downloaded followed by some interactive bar plots showing details of the demographics of length and age samples collected each year.</p>
<p><img src="images/BioSamplingTable.png" /><!-- --><img src="images/BioSamplingPlotly.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The <strong>Requested Samples</strong> tab provides a similar table detailing the requested samples for a given year, statistical fishing area, market category, fishing gear configuration, and fiscal quarter. The third tab, <strong>Comparison Plot</strong> combines the collected and requested sample totals into a figure that shows how well the port samplers were able to carry out the request for a given year. This information can be useful in planning for changes in the upcoming year or tracking where sampling efforts have continuously fallen short.</p>
<p><img src="images/BioSamplingComp.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The final tab, <strong>Length Sampling</strong>, addresses the number of length samples collected and helps the analyst determine an appropriate number of lengths to be collected to achieve a sound length frequency. The cost of sampling is now paid per length measured, so sample requests need to be carefully thought out. This tab gives a mean length, sample size, and standard error for each sampling event and then compares those statistics to a subsample of 50% less lengths in each sample.</p>

<div id="how-often-is-it-used-1" class="section level3" number="2.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> How often is it used?</h3>
<p>The Biological Sample Monitoring Database Query Tool is generally used by stock assessment analysts prior to the beginning of a new fiscal year to determine the allocation of their biological sampling requests for the upcoming year. It is also used throughout the year to evaluate the appropriateness of requested samples relative to ongoing fishing operations. The query tool may also be used in the stock assessment process for determining effective sample size information which is required in some analyses. With the addition of age samples being reported, it is possible the Age and Growth scientists may use this app throughout the year to monitor sampling intensity.</p>
</div>
<div id="has-it-been-used-in-management-1" class="section level3" number="2.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Has it been used in management?</h3>
<p>Fisheries management may affect the biosampling request process and having a better understanding of the management of a specific fishery will be beneficial in the use of this app. This tool needs to be used with the knowledge of where landings come into port and what statistical areas they were caught. In addition, the analyst should have some idea about any changes in the fishery (quotas, seasonal closures etc.). For example, if the Rhode Island black sea bass fishery doesn’t open until September, requesting 2nd fiscal quarter samples would be a waste of resources. Understanding the life history of a species (such as incoming recruitment events) is important as well when determining allocation of sample requests by market category.</p>

Observers collect information on catch and bycatch composition, protected species interactions, and gear configurations. Observer data directly inform stock assessments which monitor the exploitation rate of fisheries. Stock assessments use observer data to estimate discards/bycatch and ,if dockside monitoring is limited, the size and age composition of landings. In addition to monitoring discard amounts, observer data can provide a more detailed look at fishing behavior.
This app was developed to explore the spatial and temporal aspects of existing observer data and provide an efficient tool for stock assessment. It gives analysts and reviewers the opportunity to efficiently query and visualize observer data throughout the assessment process. The user can subset the data by catch type, species, gear type, and by month(s) and year(s). The option to overlay fall and/or spring NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey catches is also available. Users can adjust the catch size bins in the legend and download all data into a csv file or save the currently displayed map as an image.</p>
<div id="user-specifications-1" class="section level4" number="2.4.1.1">

<p>The user populates the widgets in the interface on the left side of the page (catch type, species, gear type, range of years and months, catch bin sizes, and option to overlay spring or fall survey data) and then clicks the <strong>RUN</strong> button to begin the query. A status bar showing progress then appears in the bottom right corner of the page until the process is complete and the map in the main panel refreshes.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Application Purpose</h3>
<p>Stock assessments analyze and report fish population dynamics including information on changes in abundance of fishery stocks in response to fishing and the environment. Population models utilize fishery-independent data to estimate a time series of population abundance, size and age composition, and fishing mortality. The NEFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys are the longest running, continuous time-series of bottom fish and marine invertebrate sampling in the world and one of the main sources of fishery-independent data used in stock assessments in the Northeastern United States. The original survey analysis software was a Fortran program known as SURVAN. It evolved into SAGA (Survey Area Graphical Analysis) which was developed as an interactive tool for assessment scientists to pull survey data from the Oracle database with various user specifications (species, years, seasons, strata, gear and vessel calibrations, etc.). With recent updates this application has depreciated and is no longer supported. Consequently, this new Shiny SAGA application was developed. Static results of the survey has also been developed in an Oracle framework within a stock assessment system known as StockEff.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> Application Purpose</h3>
<p>The North Atlantic Right Whale Decision Support Tool App was built to assist managers, decision makers, and stakeholders with visualizing and understanding spatiotemporal overlap between fixed fishing gear (traps, pots, gillnets, and aquaculture) and large whales distributions in the US, particulatly the North Atlantic Right Whale (NARW). The model calculates how risk of entanglement to NARW may change as a result of changes to the spatial distribution and configuration of fishing gear. Within the model, risk posed to a whale species is calculated as the product of: (1) the density of fishing gear at a given location, (2) the threat the gear poses to the whale population taking into account various gear configurations, dimensions, and entanglement reduction measures, and (3) the density of whales expected in the given location. The result is a relative risk “score” for given scenarios of when, where, and how fishing occurs.
The Decision Support Tool (DST) was developed as a function to be run in the R statistical software. In order to make the tool more accessible to a broader audience, a Shiny app was created with the intention of it eventually being hosted on a public facing server. This would allow users to access the DST through a website and be able to run potential management scenarios with the more user-friendly form of a graphical user interface.</p>
<div id="user-specifications-3" class="section level4" number="2.6.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1.1</span> User Specifications</h4>
<p>Under the <strong>Specify Model</strong> dashboard menu, users can choose to open or modify an existing scenario (this specifies gear restrictions, spatial extents/restrictions, and management actions) from the dropdown OR create a new scenario by adding actions to the interactive spreadsheet. Next, the type of fishery and whale species are specified using the dropdown widgets and a new name applied to your scenario run should be entered. Other model specifics can also be turned on or off and then a click of the <strong>Run Model</strong> button executes the model. Model status updates and warnings will print below the input spreadsheet until completion.</p>
<p><img src="images/DSTInputs.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>An RMarkdown file was created with detailed instructions and more information on how to use the app under the <strong>Additional Info</strong> tab.

<p>The DST was created in response to a request from the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (TRT) for a decision-making tool to aid them in risk reduction under various fishing scenarios. The TRT is made up of scientists, members of fishing industry, state and federal managers, and conservationists, that utilize this tool regularly to understand the impacts of fishing gear and work together to mitigate risks of entanglement on large whales. This app allows all TRT members to run scenarios without the complexity of modeling software and skills.</p>
