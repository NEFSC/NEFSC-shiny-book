Each chapter describes a different shiny app developed at the Northeast Fisheries Center. Many of the apps shared here are under ongoing development and the purpose of this book is to share our work and the lessons we’ve learned through developing these apps. 1.1 Welcome Welcome to the shiny group. If you are here then there is agood chance you are either interested in finding out what apps the group are working on or you are considering collaborating on or creating an app yourself. Information on this page should help get you started. 1.2 Getting Started All apps developed by the shiny group are located on the internal server shiny1. Anyone who is inside of the NEFSC firewall (either physically or via VPN) should be able to run any of the apps developed by the shiny group. (Login credentials are required to contribute an app or to collaborate with others on the development of an app.) Each app developed by a particular user will reside in a unique folder under their account name. The following url format is used to run any app http://shiny1.nefsc.noaa.gov:3838/username/appname. The app is physically located at \\\\net.nefsc.noaa.gov\\shiny1\\username\\appname 1.3 Required Credentials Credentials are required to access the source code of any app. An account/permissions to access the shiny1 server If working remotely then a VPN account is also required. The VPN account is needed (only if working remotely) to run the app and to update/develop an app on the server Please contact ITD for help in setting up accounts and providing access. 1.4 Saving the app A shiny app can be developed: locally (and then copied to the server) or directly on the server. Rstudio is installed on the shiny (shiny1) server to help with live testing of an app. To launch Rstudio in a browser use the following url: http://shiny1.nefsc.noaa.gov then log in with credentials. Save apps to \\\\net.nefsc.noaa.gov\\shiny1\\username\\appname "],["authentication.html", "2 Authentication 2.1 Application Purpose 2.2 Uses", " 2 Authentication App name: authenticate Developer(s): Andy Beet Point of contact: Andy Beet, andrew.beet@noaa.gov, (EDAB) Keywords: credentials, authentication, password, database Key Packages: DBI/odbc GitHub: https://github.com/andybeet/authenticate 2.1 Application Purpose A simple front end to authenticate a user. Authentication is based on database access credentials. If another app requires access to an internal database this front end can be included in the app to add a layer of authentication. 2.2 Uses Not presently incorporated into any other app. However several other apps currently in development may benefit from its use.

Any right whale sightings are then intergrated into the Right Whale Sightings Advisory System and the “Trigger Analysis” app (below) is used to evaluate for potential dynamic protection zones. 4.1.2 Trigger Analysis This app is used to evaluate if visual sightings or acoustic detections trigger dynamic management areas (aka right whale SLOW zones), and then it calculates the boundaries. A report and letter are generated here that detail the area where vessels should reduce their speeds, and these products are then emailed to GARFO to initiate the request. A kml is also generated which is used to display the zone on the Right Whale Sightings Advisory System interactive map. 4.1.3 Photo Position Finder This app will finalize the photo submission spreadsheet NEFSC submits to the North Atlantic Right whale Consortium by gathering latitude and longitude from the .gps files for the date and time specified. From this position, “Area” will be determined and other details are auto-filled. 4.2 How often is it used? The Aerial Survey Processing App is used after every right whale aerial survey – for example, in 2019, NEFSC surveyed for right whales on 92 different days, so this is a frequently used tool. The Trigger Analysis App is used each time a right whale sighting is reported to the Right Whale Sighting Advisory System to evaluate for a dynamic protection zone. In 2019, Dynamic Management Areas were initiated or extended 29 times, but the app was used more than this to evaluate sightings that also did not trigger these zones. The Photo Position Finder App is generally used 2–3 times a year when we organize our photo data for submission. 4.3 Has it been used in management? This app is used to inform and request management decisions and is an integral part of the Right Whale SLOW zone program.
