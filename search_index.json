Each chapter describes a different shiny app developed at the Northeast Fisheries Center. Many of the apps shared here are under ongoing development and the purpose of this book is to share our work and the lessons weâ€™ve learned through developing these apps. 1.1 Getting started All apps developed by the shiny group are located the internal server shiny1. Anyone who is inside of the NEFSC firewall (either physically or via VPN) should be able to run any of the apps developed by the shiny group. Login credentials are required to contribute or collaborate on the development of an app. Please contact ITD for help in setting up an account and providing access. Each app developed by a particular user will reside in a unique folder under their account name. The following url format is used to run any app http://shiny1.nefsc.noaa.gov:3838/userName/appName A shiny app can be developed locally (and then copied to the server) or directly on the server. Rstudio is installed on the shiny server to help with live testing of an app. "],["getting-started-1.html", "2 Getting Started 2.1 Welcome 2.2 Connecting to server 2.3 Needed Credetials 2.4 Saving the app", " 2 Getting Started 2.1 Welcome 2.2 Connecting to server 2.3 Needed Credetials 2.4 Saving the app "],["template.html", "3 Template 3.1 Application Purpose 3.2 Uses", " 3 Template Developer(s): Developer Name Point of contact: Developer Name, developer.name@noaa.gov Keywords: Keyword 1, Keyword 2, Keyword 3 3.1 Application Purpose Description of app. Include a link to internal app. 3.2 Uses How often is it used?
