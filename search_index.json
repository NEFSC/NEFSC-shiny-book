Each chapter describes a different shiny app developed at the Northeast Fisheries Center. Many of the apps shared here are under ongoing development and the purpose of this book is to share our work and the lessons we’ve learned through developing these apps. 1.1 Welcome Welcome to the shiny group. If you are here then there is agood chance you are either interested in finding out what apps the group are working on or you are considering collaborating on or creating an app yourself. Information on this page should help get you started. 1.2 Getting Started All apps developed by the shiny group are located on the internal server shiny1. Anyone who is inside of the NEFSC firewall (either physically or via VPN) should be able to run any of the apps developed by the shiny group. (Login credentials are required to contribute an app or to collaborate with others on the development of an app.) Each app developed by a particular user will reside in a unique folder under their account name. The following url format is used to run any app http://shiny1.nefsc.noaa.gov:3838/username/appname. The app is physically located at \\\\net.nefsc.noaa.gov\\shiny1\\username\\appname 1.3 Required Credentials Credentials are required to access the source code of any app. An account/permissions to access the shiny1 server If working remotely then a VPN account is also required. The VPN account is needed (only if working remotely) to run the app and to update/develop an app on the server Please contact ITD for help in setting up accounts and providing access. 1.4 Saving the app A shiny app can be developed: locally (and then copied to the server) or directly on the server. Rstudio is installed on the shiny (shiny1) server to help with live testing of an app. To launch Rstudio in a browser use the following url: http://shiny1.nefsc.noaa.gov then log in with credentials. Save apps to \\\\net.nefsc.noaa.gov\\shiny1\\username\\appname "],["authentication.html", "2 Authentication 2.1 Application Purpose 2.2 Uses", " 2 Authentication App name: authenticate Developer(s): Andy Beet Point of contact: Andy Beet, andrew.beet@noaa.gov, (EDAB) Keywords: credentials, authentication, password, database Key Packages: DBI/odbc GitHub: https://github.com/andybeet/authenticate 2.1 Application Purpose A simple front end to authenticate a user. Authentication is based on database access credentials. If another app requires access to an internal database this front end can be included in the app to add a layer of authentication. 2.2 Uses Not presently incorporated into any other app. However several other apps currently in development may benefit from its use.

Any right whale sightings are then intergrated into the Right Whale Sightings Advisory System and the “Trigger Analysis” app (below) is used to evaluate for potential dynamic protection zones. 3.1.2 Trigger Analysis This app is used to evaluate if visual sightings or acoustic detections trigger dynamic management areas (aka right whale SLOW zones), and then it calculates the boundaries. A report and letter are generated here that detail the area where vessels should reduce their speeds, and these products are then emailed to GARFO to initiate the request. A kml is also generated which is used to display the zone on the Right Whale Sightings Advisory System interactive map. 3.1.3 Photo Position Finder This app will finalize the photo submission spreadsheet NEFSC submits to the North Atlantic Right whale Consortium by gathering latitude and longitude from the .gps files for the date and time specified. From this position, “Area” will be determined and other details are auto-filled. 3.2 How often is it used? The Aerial Survey Processing App is used after every right whale aerial survey – for example, in 2019, NEFSC surveyed for right whales on 92 different days, so this is a frequently used tool. The Trigger Analysis App is used each time a right whale sighting is reported to the Right Whale Sighting Advisory System to evaluate for a dynamic protection zone. In 2019, Dynamic Management Areas were initiated or extended 29 times, but the app was used more than this to evaluate sightings that also did not trigger these zones. The Photo Position Finder App is generally used 2–3 times a year when we organize our photo data for submission. 3.3 Has it been used in management? This app is used to inform and request management decisions and is an integral part of the Right Whale SLOW zone program.

Samples include the collection of animal lengths, length frequencies, and age structures (otoliths, scales, spines, etc.) which are strategically requested to attain a representative sample of the associated stocks. All sampling is performed after the vessel lands their catch. With the implementation of electronically collected data, a modern version of the dataset (BSM) was created as an extension of the sampling effort. Sampling data are most commonly used to inform the stock assessment process, develop length/age models, and to characterize commercial fisheries data. This app allows the user to query all existing commercial fisheries biological sampling data, provides summaries of the sampling efforts in interactive figures and tables, and provides a sample size comparison for optimizing sampling efforts and determining future sampling requests. 4.1.1 User Specifications The user populates the widgets in the interface on the left side of the page (species, range of fiscal years, and stat areas) and then clicks the RUN button to begin the query. A status bar showing progress then appears in the bottom right corner of the page until the process is complete and the app then changes from the Read Me tab to the Collected Samples tab where results are shown. 4.1.2 App Results Once the query has finished executed, the results are divided into tabs across the top. The Collected Samples tab shows a table of sample collection results that can be sorted, searched, and downloaded followed by some interactive bar plots showing details of the demographics of length and age samples collected each year. The Requested Samples tab provides a similar table detailing the requested samples for a given year, statistical fishing area, market category, fishing gear configuration, and fiscal quarter. The third tab, Comparison Plot combines the collected and requested sample totals into a figure that shows how well the port samplers were able to carry out the request for a given year. This information can be useful in planning for changes in the upcoming year or tracking where sampling efforts have continuously fallen short. The final tab, Length Sampling, addresses the number of length samples collected and helps the analyst determine an appropriate number of lengths to be collected to achieve a sound length frequency. The cost of sampling is now paid per length measured, so sample requests need to be carefully thought out. This tab gives a mean length, sample size, and standard error for each sampling event and then compares those statistics to a subsample of 50% less lengths in each sample. 4.2 How often is it used? The Biological Sample Monitoring Database Query Tool is generally used annually by stock assessment analysts prior to the beginning of a new fiscal year to determine the allocation of their biological sampling requests for the upcoming year. It may also be used in the stock assessment process for determining effective sample size information which is required in some analyses. With the addition of age samples being reported, it is possible the Age and Growth scientists may use this app throughout the year. 4.3 Has it been used in management? This app is still in development, but fisheries management does affect the way biosampling requests are made. This really needs to be done with the knowledge of where landings came into port and what stat areas they were caught. In addition, the analyst should have some idea about any changes in the fishery (quotas, seasonal closures etc.). For example, if the Rhode Island black sea bass fishery doesn’t open until September, requesting 2nd fiscal quarter samples would be a waste. Understanding the life history of a species (such as incoming recruitment events) is important as well when determining allocation of sample requests by market category.
