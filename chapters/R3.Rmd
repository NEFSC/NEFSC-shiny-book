## Application Purpose

Think you can recognize when residuals are random versus biased? Here's a game to let you see how good you really are. Start with the 'Demo' tab to see how the different biases look. Use the 'Settings' tab to create a situation like you are accustomed to seeing in your or someone else's assessment. The 'Random or Not?' tab is the fun part. A plot is provided and you guess whether the residuals are random or biased with immediate feedback. The 'Results so far' tab lets you see how you are doing. Can you do better than random? If so, bump up the difficulty a notch and try again.

## How often is it used? 

When first developed, many members of the Population Dynamics Branch used the R3 app to test their ability to recognize random residuals in age composition plots. Many were surprised by often they were fooled, thinking random plots were not or vice versa. Results were used to modify the colors used in bubble plots in the  [ASAPplots](https://github.com/cmlegault/ASAPplots) R package used with the ASAP stock assessment program. A READ speed talk in December 2019 introduced the R3 app to a wider audience (the Resource Evaluation and Assessment Division), with a subsequent increase in usage. The R3 app is used occasionally as people wish to refresh their ability to recognize random residuals in bubble plots.
